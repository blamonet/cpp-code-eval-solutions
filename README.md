C++ code evaluation solutions

Unfortunately CodeEval uses an older version of C++, not C++11. So some of the code is not as clean as I'd like it to be since locally I compile using C++11 to learn the new syntax and I obtain the solution and then CodeEval doesn't accept it, do to missing functionality in the older version. :\
